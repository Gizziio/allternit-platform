"""
Allternit Computer Use — Measured Conformance

Executes the real conformance suite cases against the adapters actually
available on this machine and writes adapter_grades.json with MEASURED
pass rates — replacing the manifest-declared grades that were assigned
without running anything.

What gets measured:
  * Suite A (browser-deterministic-v1) against browser.mock always, and
    against browser.cdp when a CDP endpoint is reachable (--network).
  * Suite B (browser-adaptive-v1) against browser.browser-use only when a
    browser-use runtime (native import or known venv) is available.
  * Suite C (retrieval-v1) against retrieval.playwright-crawler with
    --network (headless Chromium crawl of real sites).
  * Suite E (hybrid-v1) against hybrid.orchestrator always, offline, with
    browser.mock registered as the sub-adapter — this measures orchestration
    semantics (delegation, workflow chaining, envelope), not real cross-family
    execution; the grade note says so explicitly.
  * Suite F (routing-policy-v1) — adapter-free; always measured.
  * Suite D (desktop-v1) only with --desktop (env-dependent, pyautogui).

Honesty rules:
  * Grades are written under the adapter id that was actually executed.
    Mock results are labeled browser.mock and never upgrade a real
    adapter's grade.
  * Adapters whose runtime is unavailable (e.g. browser-use not installed)
    are written with grade/pass_rate null and measured=false — no invented
    numbers.

Run:  python -m conformance.measured [--network] [--desktop]
