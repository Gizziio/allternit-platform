# Agents API

Allternit Agents is one product with two specialties:

- **Cloud Agents** — API-driven agent sessions. You create a session with an
  agent and a computer kind, send user events, and read the event stream.
  This is the same kind of product as hosted agent sessions, on Allternit's
  own session model. See [Sessions](sessions.md) for the full reference.
- **Bot Agents** — the same Agent, packaged as a teammate (Hub, Desktop,
  Fabric, @mention). Same `agents` table with `is_bot`. Persistent Computer
  Cloud desktop. Talk over CommRails. Run via ao. Sessions use
  `/api/v1/sessions` with `bot_id`.

Underneath both sits the model access layer, exposed directly for callers
who want to drive their own loop:

- **Completions** — `POST /api/agents/v1/chat/completions`
- **Responses** — `POST /api/agents/v1/responses`

## Which surface do I use?

| You want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Send a prompt and get a model completion back | Completions |
| Send a prompt with tools/instructions and get a structured response | Responses |
| Run a stateful agent over multiple turns, with events and history | Cloud Agents sessions (`/api/v1/sessions`) |
| Operate a packaged teammate (Hub / Desktop / Fabric) | Bot Agents (`Allternit.bots` + `bot_id` on a session) |

## Cloud Agents at a glance

Base URL: `/api/v1`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt>` (Clerk session
or API key — the same middleware as the rest of the platform). No
`OpenAI-Beta` header is required; if you send one it is ignored.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8013/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLERK_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent": { "model": "kimi-k2", "instructions": "Be terse." },
    "computer": { "kind": "none" },
    "input": "Summarize the repo layout.",
    "stream": false
  }'
```

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "9f…",
    "agent_id": "3c…",
    "status": "running",
    "computer": { "kind": "none", "id": null },
    "created_at": "2026-09-10 12:00:00",
    "updated_at": "2026-09-10 12:00:00",
    "archived_at": null
  }
}
```

Sessions use Allternit event type names (`session.created`, `turn.started`,
`agent.message`, …) and Allternit status names (`idle`, `running`,
`waiting`, `failed`, `archived`). Turns are listed at
`GET /api/v1/sessions/:id/turns`. Session create can bind a `brain_id` and
`vault_ids` (unknown ids return `400`). `/api/v1/vaults` is the public
alias of `/api/v1/beta/vaults`. `GET /agents/:id/toolset` returns tools, allowed_tools, allowed_skills,
MCP connectors for the caller, and booleans `tool_search` / `programmatic`
derived from those tool lists. `/api/v1/schedules` aliases `/beta/deployments`.
There is no public `/runtimes` resource; the computer binding lives on the
session. `computer.kind` `sandbox`, `desktop`, and `fabric` provision a Computer
Cloud desktop (Cloud Desktop / Incus / Tart), not Fly. `sandbox` is
ephemeral; `desktop` and `fabric` are session-lived.

## SDK

The TypeScript SDK ships a Cloud Agents client as `@allternit/sdk/cloud-agents`:

```ts
import { Allternit } from "@allternit/sdk/cloud-agents";

const allternit = new Allternit({ apiKey, baseURL: "http://localhost:8013" });
const session = await allternit.sessions.create({
  agent: { model: "kimi-k2", instructions: "Be terse." },
  computer: { kind: "none" },
  input: "Summarize the repo layout.",
});
for await (const event of allternit.sessions.events.stream(session.id)) {
  console.log(event.type, event.data);
}
await allternit.sessions.events.send(session.id, [
  { type: "user.interrupt" },
]);
await allternit.sessions.archive(session.id);
```

The Python SDK exposes the same client as `allternit.Allternit`.

### Bot Agents (`Allternit.bots`)

Bots are rows on `/api/v1/agents` with `is_bot: true`. Create, list, get,
and archive:

```ts
const bot = await allternit.bots.create({
  name: "research",
  systemPrompt: "Be terse.",
  botProfile: { tagline: "Looks things up" },
});
const session = await allternit.sessions.create({
  botId: bot.id,
  computer: { kind: "desktop" },
});
```

`bot_id` on session create uses that agent. The bot's persistent computer
is Computer Cloud (`ensureBotComputer` / `/api/v1/computers`), not a second
agent table. Policy for computer tools is the ACI gateway (Bot Agents), not
the Cloud Agents `permission` field.

## Bot Agents

Same primitive as Cloud Agents. Extra packaging:

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| Bot Mode | Who you talk to (profile, brain bind, roster) |
| CommRails | How they talk (`/api/commrails/*`, Desktop rail) |
| ao | How they run (spawn / watch / harness) |
| Computer | Persistent desktop bound by `bot_id` |
| Policy | Fail-closed ACI before computer acts |

## Notes

- Completions and Responses (`/api/agents/v1/*`) are unchanged by the Cloud
  Agents release and are documented with the model-routing surface.
- `/api/v1/beta/sessions` keeps working as an alias over the same sessions
  table. New integrations should use `/api/v1/sessions`.
- `computer.kind` `sandbox` / `desktop` / `fabric` provision Computer Cloud.
  No VM driver on this host → `503` `computer_unavailable` (fail-closed).
- `computer.kind: "local"` is a descriptor only: the session records the
  intent and accepts events, but no worker is attached.
