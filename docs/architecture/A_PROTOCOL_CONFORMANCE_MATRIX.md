# A:// Conformance Test Matrix

**Status:** Reference / proof index. Every row names its concrete proof:
a test in `infrastructure/executor/cowork/cowork/allternit-cowork-runtime/tests/transport_conformance_tests.rs`,
an endpoint behavior, or live-demo evidence (run 2026-09-12 against a real
server, recorded in the PR #429/#436 bodies and the session attestations).

The rule being enforced (§16 of `A_PROTOCOL.md` / §16 of the index README):

> A component that only stores an `a://` identifier is not A:// conformant.

See the last section for the adjacent-plumbing inventory.

## 1. Worker conformance (§17 list)

| Claim | Proof | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Resolve/authenticate a principal identity | `authenticate_principal` exercised in every test via `auth()`; failure paths live (bad token → `A_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`) | ✅ |
| Declare and satisfy capabilities | Eligibility rejection asserted: `test_adversarial_two_worker_failover` (no-shell principal → `A_CAPABILITY_MISSING`); concurrent winner test | ✅ |
| Claim work under canonical execution-ownership rules | Store-level CAS: `test_concurrent_claims_single_winner` (8 threads, exactly 1 winner); targeted claim conflict → `A_JOB_ALREADY_LEASED` | ✅ |
| Maintain or lose a lease correctly | Heartbeat + renew asserted (`test_adversarial_two_worker_failover`); renew of stale gen → `A_STALE_LEASE_GENERATION`; expiry by server clock in both failover tests | ✅ |
| Emit attributable events | Every event-row assertion checks the initiator/delegator/executor triple (`event_rows` helper); live ledger dumps in PR #429 | ✅ |
| Obey approval/policy boundaries | `test_full_824_sequence_with_approval` (request→grant→gate→invalidate→re-obtain); `test_approval_expiry_and_late_grant_rejected`; `test_risk_policy_single_evaluation_path` (auto-approve/auto-deny/requires) | ✅ |
| Reject stale execution authority | Ghost completion → `A_STALE_LEASE_GENERATION` **even on terminal jobs**; ghost heartbeat rejected; stale approval → `A_APPROVAL_INVALID` (live: "approval … is bound to lease generation 1, current is 2") | ✅ |
| Commit a result exactly once | Duplicate completion → `already_committed` + identical `result_id`; `test_event_post_idempotency` extends the same guarantee to client events (3 deliveries → 2 rows) | ✅ |

## 2. Control-surface conformance (§17 list)

| Claim | Proof | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Create or observe intents | `test_intent_submission_idempotent` (idempotent on intent_id, canonical run, attribution, version/cycle rejection) + `POST/GET /fabric/transport/intents` live | ✅ |
| Observe canonical run state | `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/:id/jobs`, `GET /fabric/transport/jobs/:id` read the store; state-machine reference in `COWORK_RUNTIME_STATE_MACHINES.md` | ✅ (API) |
| Display approvals | `GET /fabric/transport/approvals` inbox (workspace/status filter) + grant/deny; `GET /cowork/approvals` user-filtered (#422); `/fabric-transport` control view renders the inbox with decided_by reasons (auto-approvals show WHY, not silent) | ✅ |
| Display attributed events | `GET /runs/:id/events` + SSE stream return attribution columns (V154) | ✅ (API; UI partial) |
| Display completion/failure | CompleteOutcome + job view expose state/result; run advanced to terminal; rendered in `/fabric-transport` run detail | ✅ |

## 3. §8.24 proof-of-protocol sequence

| Step | Proof |
|---|---|
| 1–4 intent → run → job → queue | Run/job routes; `start_run` stops at `queued` (§8.2 honesty, #429) |
| 5–7 eligibility, auth, claim gen 1 | Adversarial test + live demo (worker A, `lease_89b1…`) |
| 8–12 protected action → approval → grant → resume | `test_full_824_sequence_with_approval` + live demo (`appr_3709…` granted, payment step executed) |
| 13–17 worker killed → expiry → approvals invalidated → requeue | Sweeper CAS asserted (state, retry_count, lease cleared); `approval.invalidated` with executor attribution; live server-log line captured |
| 18–20 replacement claims gen 2, checkpoint replay, protected action re-evaluated | Grant carried `current_checkpoint_id`; replay from step 1 (live) / step boundary (test); re-check → `A_APPROVAL_INVALID` |
| 21–23 re-approval, completion, exactly-once result | Binding 2 under gen 2 granted; `result.created` exactly once; duplicate → canonical `result_id` |
| 24 canonical state observable | Job view + run `completed` in store |
| 25 ledger triple | `initiator=user/joe`, `delegator=principal/al`, `executor=A→B` on every material event (test assertions + live dump) |
| Killed worker cannot complete later | Ghost completion `A_STALE_LEASE_GENERATION` (asserted post-completion, live 409) |

## 4. The four locks (§8.0)

| Lock | Proof |
|---|---|
| 1. Canonical store = Rust runtime SQLite as wired in cmd/allternit-api | All protocol fns take `rusqlite::Connection` over the API's DB (`DbHandle::connect` in handlers; same file the sweeper/rehydration uses); conformance tests run the identical store code on temp DBs |
| 2. Claims atomic at the persistence layer | `UPDATE cowork_jobs … WHERE id=? AND state='queued' RETURNING lease_generation` in an immediate transaction; concurrency test; no in-process lock anywhere in the claim path |
| 3. Recovery = replay from last committed checkpoint; server clock authoritative | `current_checkpoint_id` in LeaseGrant; sweeper/boot expiry judged on stored `lease_expires_at` vs `Utc::now()` — `worker_time` is accepted but never read for expiry; downtime test |
| 4. v0.1 discovery = long-poll claim | `wait_secs` loop in the claim handler; documented as the only correctness-relevant discovery; no push machinery in the protocol path |

## 5. Adjacent plumbing, NOT conformance

These store `a://`-shaped data or touch the vocabulary without participating
in the lifecycle. Per §16 they must not be cited as A:// conformance:

| Component | Why it is not conformance | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `cowork_executions` dead-end inserts (`cowork_routes.rs` run-agent/team-execute) | Rows are inserted and never read back; no run/job lifecycle, no lease | Contract Appendix A |
| gizzi-code fake remote modes | Simulated remote execution without principal auth, leases, or attributed events | Out of scope per slice |
| cloud-api cowork models (`cmd/allternit-cloud-api`) | A second, separate run/job store (Postgres/sqlx) that does not participate in the canonical SQLite spine | Lock 1; Appendix A |
| `agents` / `cowork_personas` tables | Store model/provider/prompt and persona data — product records, not execution principals; unlinked to `cowork_principals` | `BOT_AUTHORING_SPEC.md` §0 |
| Webhook subscription/trigger routes | Emit/ingest events into their own pipeline; they do not create canonical Intent/Run work | `BOT_AUTHORING_SPEC.md` §9 |
| Artifact `a://` address display in Cowork/chat | An address string rendered in UI; no lifecycle participation | artphase2 ledger entry |
| `cowork_memory_entries`, schedules DB | Scoped data/trigger substrate; durable but not execution-ownership state | — |
| CommRails ledger mirroring of runtime events | Transport substrate carrying already-attributed events; carries semantics, does not define them | `A_PROTOCOL.md` §15 |

## 5b. Task-DAG items A-T1–A-T5 (closed)

| Item | Proof |
|---|---|
| A-T1 handoff chains + ack | `test_handoff_ack_completes_linked_job` (linked job terminated with typed result, executor attribution, idempotent replay); cyclic handoff chains rejected at the route; `POST /runs/:id/handoffs/:hid/ack` |
| A-T2 per-principal memory grants | `test_memory_principal_grants` (owner/grantee/stranger visibility, default-deny write check); `/cowork/memory` with `principal`/`grants` |
| A-T3 Al orchestration loop v0.1 | `test_al_orchestration_loop` (rule-based delegation, attributed delegation.created/rejected/completed, parent-run mirroring, no double delegation); boot tick in `main.rs` |
| A-T4 Gizzi claim loop | `cmd/gizzi-code/src/runtime/fabric-transport/worker.ts` — long-poll claim, `Sandbox.wrap` posture, heartbeat, checkpoints, typed Result; typechecked; live demo evidence |
| A-T5 connector broker v0.1 | `test_connector_broker_sessions` (secret-free sessions, principal-bound, approval-gated critical capabilities, honest simulated invoke, attributed connector.invoked); live demo evidence |

## 6. Honest gaps in the conformance story

- **Non-local compute** — all conformance proofs run `compute: local`;
  placement is out of scope for v0.1 (lock 1, §8.8).
- **Al/Gizzi as live workers** — Gizzi's claim loop is implemented
  (`fabric-transport/worker.ts`) but runs on-demand (bun entry), not as an
  installed service; Al's loop is the deterministic orchestrator (no persona
  runtime yet). Conformance claims attach when they operate continuously.
- **UI conformance depth** — the `/fabric-transport` control view satisfies
  the §17 control list minimally; rich protocol-entity rendering (leases,
  DAG graphs, timelines) remains ongoing product work.
- **Delegation chain enforcement coverage** — chains are validated on intent
  submission and job creation; enforcement on other write paths (handoffs)
  is not universal.

Proven in this pass: `test_default_principal_seeding_and_token_provisioning`
(Gap 1), agent creation minting the principal in-transaction (Gap 2, build +
live evidence), `test_delegation_chain_cycle_and_depth` (Gap 3),
`test_intent_submission_idempotent` (Gap 4), `/fabric-transport` view +
approvals inbox (Gap 5, typechecked).
