# Finalize PR #1 — HTML artifact publish pipeline

PR: https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-platform/pull/1 (branch `ao/html-artifacts`)

## Context

This PR (4-phase HTML artifact pipeline: gizzi-code CLI → `allternit-api` backend → iOS Artifacts Library) was built and reviewed earlier this session and is functionally complete — its own steering checkpoint says "all four phases are complete pending final human review." It has sat open while unrelated work merged into `main` (PRs #2, #3, #4, #5, #7, #9), and now shows `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY` / `mergeable: CONFLICTING`.

**Already investigated — the conflict is narrow and understood:**
```
git merge-tree $(git merge-base origin/main origin/ao/html-artifacts) origin/main origin/ao/html-artifacts
```
shows real conflicts in exactly two files: `.steering/checkpoint.md` and `.steering/spec.md`. These are auto-managed pipeline-state tracking files (see `GIZZI.md`'s "Steering / pipeline" section) — `main` has since moved on to newer, unrelated steering checkpoints (currently an "M4: second brain" effort) that have nothing to do with this PR's content. **Resolution: take `main`'s version of both files** (they're ephemeral tracking state, not this PR's actual payload — same resolution already applied successfully to PR #2's identical conflict pattern). Do NOT try to merge/reconcile their content; main's version simply wins.

No file-level overlap exists between this PR's real payload (`cmd/allternit-api/*`, `cmd/gizzi-code/src/runtime/artifacts/*`, `surfaces/allternit-mobile/ios/Features/Artifacts/*`, `surfaces/allternit-mobile/ios/Core/API/CanvasClient.swift`) and anything merged since — confirmed via `gh pr view 1 --json files` cross-checked against the file lists of PRs #4/#5/#9. This should be a clean, mechanical conflict resolution, not a real rebase of feature logic.

## Task

1. Check out `ao/html-artifacts`, merge `origin/main` in, resolve the two `.steering/*` conflicts by taking main's version (`git checkout --theirs .steering/checkpoint.md .steering/spec.md` after starting the merge — verify this actually pulls main's side given merge direction, don't assume `--theirs`/`--ours` map the way you'd guess; confirm by reading the resolved file's content matches `git show origin/main:.steering/checkpoint.md` before committing).
2. After resolving, verify nothing else broke: `git diff --stat` against the pre-merge state should show only the two steering files touched by the merge resolution, nothing else.
3. Re-verify the PR's own claims still hold given how much has changed on `main` since Phase 4 was completed:
   - `swiftc -parse` on the 5 changed/new iOS files (`CanvasClient.swift`, `ArtifactLibraryStore.swift`, `ArtifactDetailsView.swift`, `ArtifactsLibraryView.swift`, `SandboxedArtifactWebView.swift`) — same lightweight syntax gate used elsewhere in this session's review process.
   - Confirm the Rust files (`auth.rs`, `canvas_routes.rs`, `connector_routes.rs`, the `V33` migration) still apply cleanly with no adjacent code drift from other merged work (there was none found in the conflict check above, but re-confirm after the actual merge commit).
   - Read `docs/HTML_ARTIFACTS_PHASE_4_NOTES.md` for the original verification evidence (real CLI→backend→iOS loop run twice, Cargo tests) — you don't need to re-run that full loop, just confirm nothing in the merge touched the verified surface.
4. Push the resolved merge commit to `ao/html-artifacts`.

## Constraints

- Do not touch anything under `surfaces/allternit-mobile/ios/Features/Automation/`, `Core/API/CronClient.swift`, `Core/CronJobStore.swift`, `Core/API/PermissionClient.swift`, `Features/Code/ChangesetReviewSheet.swift`, or `docs/SURFACE_AUDIT*`/`docs/CHANGESET_REVIEW*`/`docs/AUTOMATION_TASKS*`/`docs/CI_ISSUE_6*` — separate work happening elsewhere.
- Do not merge the PR yourself — resolve and push only; final review/merge happens separately.
- If step 3 turns up a real (not steering-file) problem, stop and document it precisely in the notes rather than papering over it.

## Deliverable

`docs/PR1_FINALIZE_NOTES.md`, YAML frontmatter (`status`, `files_changed`, `deviations`, `remaining`), then prose confirming the merge is clean and what you verified. That file existing = done.
