//! Service-to-service auth for internal-only routes.
//!
//! No such mechanism existed before this: every existing route is either
//! Clerk-JWT-authenticated (end users) or a public OAuth redirect target
//! (`connector_public_router`). The ACU (computer-use) Python gateway is
//! neither — it's a peer service with no Clerk session — so routes it calls
//! (cloud-credential resolution, usage-event ingestion) are gated by a shared
//! secret instead, following the same fail-closed posture as
//! `token_crypto::open`: no token configured means the route is unreachable,
//! not silently permissive, except for the same localhost-only local-dev
//! bypass `auth_middleware` already uses.
