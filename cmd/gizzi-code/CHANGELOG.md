# Changelog

## Unreleased

Grok-style agent dashboard and session-info polish.

### Added
- `/dashboard` (aliases `/agents-dashboard`, `/sessions`, keybind Ctrl+\):
  full-screen agent dashboard. Dispatch top-level sessions from the input
  box, watch state dots (working / awaiting input / done / failed), peek the
  last response inline and reply (replies queue to running sessions), open a
  transcript details view (`v`) — full transcript rendered by the real
  Messages component (markdown, thinking blocks, tool chrome), scrollable
  (↑/↓, Ctrl+U/D, g/G) with live sticky tail, not a text excerpt — search
  (`/`, prefixes `a:` activity,
  `s:` state, `#` id), group by state or directory (Ctrl+G), rename (`r`),
  pin (`p`), reorder (Shift+↑/↓), stop/remove (`x`). Pin and order persist
  under the `dashboard` config key.
- `/status` gains `/info` and `/session-info` aliases plus Auth method and
  Turns rows; session id copy (`c`) and whole-block copy (`y`) in the
  Settings → Status tab.
- `/settings` Config tab: Effort row (low/medium/high/max).

### Changed
- Dashboard rows show an animated spinner while a session is working
  (was a static glyph), the peek panel renders the real permission
  request inline so tool prompts can be answered without leaving the
  dashboard (number keys 1-9 pick the option), and the main-session row
  now reflects live state (working / needs-input) instead of always
  reading idle.

### Fixed
- Shrinking lines no longer leave stale trailing characters ("ghosts") on
  screen. Root cause: the non-TTY full-frame serializer (`renderFullFrame`,
  used whenever stdout is piped, e.g. `gizzi | tee` — stdin still comes
  from /dev/tty so the session stays interactive) emitted trimEnd'd rows
  with no per-row erase, and alt-screen frames re-land on the same region
  every render, so cells past a shrunken row kept whatever an earlier,
  longer frame wrote. Every row now ends with erase-to-EOL. Defense in
  depth: the TTY diff path also sweeps each changed row and emits
  erase-to-EOL when the painted extent shrinks (no per-frame full clear).

## 2.0.7 — 2026-09-06

### Changed
- First-run onboarding always auto-picks the default brain instead of
  prompting: Allternit Cloud on paid Plus/Super/Ultra plans, otherwise the
  first installed CLI. Same logic as `gizzi onboarding --defaults`; change
  anytime with `/model`.

### Fixed
- `gizzi auto` no longer fails to load in bundled builds: the
  `TRANSCRIPT_CLASSIFIER` bundle feature was being queried inside an arrow
  return and a getter (illegal for Bun's `feature()` macro), which broke
  the command module and the test preload graph.
- `bun run typecheck` is clean again repo-wide: the native-sessions catalog
  re-exported `HARNESS_BY_ID` without importing it (TS2552).

## 2.0.6 — 2026-09-06

Fixes a hard TUI crash on any surface that renders a syntax-highlighted
diff — reported via `/theme`, but file-edit permission previews share the
same component:

    TypeError: new ColorDiff(...).render is not a function

The vendored TypeScript port of color-diff-napi had only implemented the
color-math API, so the fast render path was a guaranteed crash. The port
now renders for real.

### Fixed
- `/theme` and diff previews no longer crash: the color-diff TS shim
  accepts the diff-render constructor and `ColorFile` construction used by
  `HighlightedCode` (file-write permission previews), and both `render()`
  calls are guarded so any future shim drift degrades to the fallback
  renderer instead of killing the TUI.

### Added
- Real syntax highlighting in the compiled binary: a pure-TS tokenizer
  (ts/js/py/go/rust/java/c/ruby/php/shell/json/css/html/markdown/config/
  sql), theme-aware diff backgrounds (incl. daltonized + ansi themes),
  line-number gutters, and width wrapping. The theme picker footer now
  names the active syntax theme.

## 2.0.5 — 2026-09-05

`/model` lists Allternit Cloud first, then installed CLIs, then local.
npm publish verify downloads with `npm pack` so registry blob lag cannot
fail a release that already published.

### Changed
- `/model` and `gizzi models` group brains: Allternit Cloud, CLI, local.

### Fixed
- Publish verify used anonymous curl of the npm tarball; metadata could
  appear minutes before the blob (2.0.2 and 2.0.4). Verify now uses
  `npm pack` with exponential backoff.

## 2.0.4 — 2026-09-05

Non-interactive first-run setup. `gizzi onboarding --defaults` picks an
installed CLI brain (or Allternit Cloud on a paid sub) without a TTY.

### Added
- `gizzi onboarding --defaults` — telemetry on, auth skipped, auto brain.

## 2.0.3 — 2026-09-05

Session children no longer survive close. Installed CLI brains (including
Grok) work without an Allternit API key. A Plus/Super/Ultra subscription
auto-defaults the brain to Allternit Cloud.

### Fixed
- Sidecar, CLI, shell, mux, and computer-use children are tracked and
  reaped on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP/exit instead of detaching+unrefing.
- Desktop quit kills the gizzi process tree and stops the always-on daemon.
- `gizzi exec -m grok/default` crashed with `Auth.profilesForProvider is
  not a function`. Subprocess CLIs are treated as already-authed.
- Grok ACP spawn uses `--no-leader` so it does not attach to a parent TUI.

### Added
- First-run onboarding can pick an installed CLI as the default brain.
- Paid Plus/Super/Ultra (from `/api/v1/billing/subscription`) auto-sets
  `allternit/<cloud-model>` unless `/model` is pinned (`model_auto: false`).

## 2.0.2 — 2026-09-05

Windows is a supported platform. Credentials use DPAPI (CurrentUser) instead
of a plaintext file. Windows install paths: PowerShell installer, Scoop, winget.

### Changed
- Windows secure storage: DPAPI `ProtectedData` CurrentUser, with the
  existing plaintext file as last-resort fallback.
- Removed the boot-time “experimental / unsupported” Windows warning.
- Platform support table lists Windows as supported.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-09-05

Distribution completeness. Product naming is Allternit-only on the first-party
path. GitHub Release assets ship alongside npm so curl/Homebrew/Scoop can
install the same version.

### Changed
- Drop shipped Bedrock `anthropic.claude-*` model IDs.
- Product-owned Anthropic identifiers, first-party hosts, and remaining
  `x-claude-*` headers renamed to Allternit. Third-party npm names, models.dev
  provider id `"anthropic"`, Claude model IDs, and leftover-detect of upstream
  installs remain.
- npm publish also cuts a GitHub Release (`gizzi-code/v*`) with version-named
  tar.gz/zip assets and `checksums.txt`.
- Installer, Homebrew, Scoop, Chocolatey, Arch, RPM, and winget manifests
  point at `gizzi-code/v<version>` and try the unprefixed tag as fallback.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-04

Breaking naming purge. `CLAUDE_CODE_*` environment variables are no longer
read. Use `GIZZI_*` (same suffix). There is no fallback window.

### Breaking
- Env vars: `CLAUDE_CODE_X` → `GIZZI_X` with zero legacy fallback.
  `readGizziEnv` / `setGizziEnv` touch only the `GIZZI_` form.
- Product copy, docs, and feedback URLs no longer say "Claude Code".
- Hint protocol tag is `<gizzi-hint />` (`<claude-code-hint />` still parsed).

### Changed
- npm distribution is now cross-platform: the launcher shim
  (bin/gizzi.js) resolves the binary from a bundled dist/ or from the
  optional platform packages `@allternit/gizzi-code-<platform>-<arch>`
  (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-arm64, linux-x64, win32-x64), which are
  built per-platform in CI and published alongside the main package.
  `npm install -g @allternit/gizzi-code` now yields a working CLI on every
  supported platform.
- User-visible Claude/Anthropic fork traces removed: system-prompt presets,
  built-in agent prompts, TUI strings, and config-dir defaults are
  Gizzi-branded (`~/.gizzi` first, `~/.claude` retained as read-only
  legacy fallback). Model names and provider-genuine text (Anthropic API
  auth, wire protocol) are unchanged. See `docs/anthropic-allowlist.md`.
- Windows is now explicitly labeled experimental/unsupported (macOS primary,
  Linux supported). The CLI prints a one-line stderr warning on boot on
  win32: no secure credential store — credentials fall back to a
  permission-hardened local file.
- Shell profile edits are marker-disciplined: the installer writes PATH
  lines between `# gizzi-code begin` / `# gizzi-code end`, and the
  uninstaller removes only that block. Profiles without markers are left
  untouched (with a warning) instead of being rewritten line-by-line.
- install.ps1: exact semicolon-delimited User PATH comparison, an explicit
  note when using the x64 build on ARM64, and a clear error under a
  Restricted execution policy.

### Docs
- README "Platform support" section; mirrored one-liner in
  docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-09-04

Production-readiness release.

### Fixed
- `gizzi exec` and other one-shot commands hanging forever after completing
  (background runtime handles held the event loop).
- Production build crash (`import type` in db.ts) and bundler syntax errors.
- SSRF in the web proxy (redirect chasing, DNS rebinding, CGNAT range).
- Dead cloud defaults repointed to api.allternit.com / headscale.allternit.com.
- Installer scripts (curl | bash, PowerShell) — tag parsing, asset names,
  checksum verification; proven against a live release.
- `gizzi upgrade` version check and npm package targeting.

### Security
- Committed Clerk test key removed; gitleaks CI gate added (rotate any
  previously committed keys).
- Hardcoded dev-token acceptance removed from the platform auth server and
  cloud-api (operator-configured escape hatch defaults off and refuses in
  production).
- Token storage moved to sha256 (cloud-api); scoped `alt_` API tokens.
- `gizzi api-keys` command with durability heuristics (durable `alt_` keys vs
  short-lived Clerk JWTs).

### Added
- CI quality gates on release workflows (typecheck + smoke suite + built
  binary smoke).
- `gizzi api-keys list/set/remove`.
- Centralized cloud/gateway URL constants (single flip point for the Backend B
  public deploy).
- PG migration runner in cloud-api.
- cron automation and vault test coverage; dist-staleness preflight.
