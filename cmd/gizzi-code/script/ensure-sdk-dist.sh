# ensure-sdk-dist.sh — build packages/sdk dist if it is missing or stale.
#
# Why this exists:
#   packages/sdk/dist is gitignored (only dist/gen is tracked, vendored from
#   the canonical release repo). A fresh clone/worktree therefore has a dist/
#   containing ONLY gen/, and any src/ newer than the last build leaves stale
#   output behind. Both cases make `bun run typecheck` fail with TS2307
#   ("Cannot find module '../dist/...'") in packages/sdk/scripts/verify-sdk.ts,
#   and make `bun test` silently resolve @allternit/sdk against a stale build.
#
# What this does:
#   - No-op if dist/index.js exists AND no packages/sdk/src file is newer
#     than it (find -newer check).
#   - Otherwise runs the SDK build (packages/sdk/scripts/build.mjs — plain
#     tsc emit; ~1.8k pre-existing type errors are the known baseline and do
#     not fail the build).
#   - Exits non-zero if the sentinel dist/index.js is still missing after the
#     build, so callers fail loudly instead of typechecking a broken tree.
#   - Beyond mtime: each managed package records the resolved version of its
#     runtime dependencies in a dist/.build-deps.json sidecar at build time.
#     A missing sidecar (dist predates this check) or a snapshot that no
#     longer matches the current resolution (e.g. stale pnpm workspace links
#     silently moved a package's dep from its nested node_modules to a
#     root-hoisted copy of a DIFFERENT major version) forces a rebuild. This
#     is the 2026-09-18 poisoned-dist incident guard: then, os-contracts'
#     build resolved root-hoisted zod v4 instead of its nested zod v3, errored
#     under v4, and still emitted a v4-typed .d.ts that was newer than src —
#     mtime freshness alone called it fresh. os-contracts' build config also
#     sets noEmitOnError so a type-erroring build fails instead of emitting.
#
# Usage: bash script/ensure-sdk-dist.sh   (from anywhere; resolves its own root)
# Set GIZZI_SKIP_SDK_DIST=1 to skip (e.g. CI images that pre-build the SDK).
