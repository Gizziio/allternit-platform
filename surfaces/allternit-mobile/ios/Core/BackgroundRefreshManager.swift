/// `pollPendingPermissions()` loop is a `.task` bound to that view's
/// lifecycle, so it stops the moment the view disappears. There's no
/// realistic way to keep a live socket open while suspended (iOS doesn't
/// grant that background mode to a plain client app), so this is the
/// pragmatic middle ground recommended in the plan: a periodic
/// `BGAppRefreshTask` polls the permission queue while backgrounded and
/// surfaces anything new as a local notification, so an approval request
/// doesn't sit unseen until the user happens to reopen the app.

/// True push-on-server-event (Gap 3) would remove the need for polling
/// entirely, but that needs backend device-token plumbing this client can't
/// add alone — see `docs/TODO.md`.
