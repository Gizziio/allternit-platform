// Loop REST models — base path `v1/automations` on gizzi-code's own server
// (`cmd/gizzi-code/src/runtime/server/server.ts:367,455`), same host as
// CronClient/RoutinesClient/PtyClient/PermissionClient, NOT `allternit-api`.
//
// Mirrors the row shape built in the POST insert
// (`cmd/gizzi-code/src/runtime/server/routes/automations.ts:257-267`). Like
// `Routine`, the loop row's JS object literal keys are snake_case as written
// (`agent_id`, `exit_condition`, `max_iterations`, `iteration_log`,
// `time_created`, `time_updated`), so explicit `CodingKeys` map them.
//
// Timestamps are `Date.now()` ms-epoch numbers, same as Routine — decoded as
// `Double` and converted with `Date(timeIntervalSince1970: ms / 1000)` at
// render time (`RoutinesListView.relativeText`, reused here).

/// `output` already being `stdout + stderr` concatenated (`loop-engine.ts:

/// string (`new Date().toISOString()`, unlike the row's own ms-epoch
