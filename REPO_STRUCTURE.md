# Allternit Repository Architecture

This document describes the production-grade repository setup for the Allternit ecosystem.

## Monorepo + Satellite Repos

We use a **monorepo + satellite repo** architecture:

- **`allternit-platform`** (this repo) — Core platform monorepo. Source of truth for the full stack.
- **Satellite repos** — Extracted public packages with independent release cycles.

## Core Monorepo (`allternit-platform`)

The monorepo contains everything needed to build, test, and deploy the full Allternit platform.

> The agent workspace surface (`ai.allternit.com`) is **not** in this repo — it moved to the private
> satellite `Gizziio/allternit-ai` in the 2026-09-15 OSS split. The root `ui` symlink and the old
> `rails/` directory were deleted the same week; the real communication substrate is `commrails/`.

### Runtime-state directories that must stay at root

The following dot-directories are hardcoded into live code or required by `AGENTS.md`. They stay at the repository root:

| Directory | Why it stays |
|-----------|--------------|
| `.allternit/` | Runtime state: peers, WIHs, artifacts, context-packs. Referenced by `cmd/allternit-api/`, `sdk/allternit-sdk/`, `domains/computer-use/`, `dev/scripts/`, and `AGENTS.md`. |
| `.gizzi/` | gizzi-code runtime state and brand files. Referenced by `cmd/gizzi-code/src/runtime/context/config/config.ts` and tests. |
| `.steering/` | Steering checkpoint + hook system. Required by `AGENTS.md`. |

> Reorganized 2026-07-22: removed `plugins/` (empty; card plugins live in `archive/plugins/`, runtime in `platform/plugins/`), root `src/`, `data/`, `public/`, `proof/`, `output/`, `dispatch-screenshots/`, `Desktop/` (accidental commit), and merged `analysis/` → `docs/gap-analysis/`, `reports/` → `docs/reports/`, `alabs-demos/` → `alabs-generated-courses/demos/`, `remix-plans/` → `remix-content/plans/`, `agent/`/`templates/`/`alabs-curator/` → `archive/`.
>
> Reorganized 2026-08-27: removed improperly-linked nested worktrees (`allternit-session-grok-bot-0-18-integration`, `allternit-session-multica-runtime-align`) and scratch `.tmp-*` entries from the index; deleted `.beads/`; moved `marketing/`, `upstream/`, `remix-content/`, `.pipeline/`, `.parity-reports/`, `.parity-reports-archive/`, and `.shared/` into `docs/`; moved ad-hoc root scripts into `scripts/audit/`.
>
> Reorganized 2026-09-18 (S6/S7): root `reports/`, `research/`, and most of `spec/` moved into `docs/reports/`, `docs/research/`, and `docs/specs/`; root `MASTER_TRACKING.md` and the `ALLTERNIT_CLOUD_*HANDOFF*.md` pair moved to `docs/projects/allternit-cloud/` (+ `handoffs/`); `DESIGN.md` → `docs/design/`, `AGENT_CREATION_CHECKLIST.md` → `docs/`, `ANTHROPIC_TO_ALABS_MAPPING.md` → `docs/learnings/`; loose `docs/` depth-1 program docs filed into `docs/programs/<program>/` (S7). Deliberate root exceptions, kept because live code reads them from repo root: `spec/Contracts/` (validate_law.py, context-pack-builder, gateway service), `GIZZI.md` (workspace-instruction file loaded by allternit-api/gizzi-code from cwd), `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` (electron-builder extraFiles in the desktop release).

## Ownership rules (source of truth)

Where new code goes — adopted 2026-09-18 (S0 of the folder reorganization):

- **`cmd/`** = executables (CLI binaries, API servers, daemons).
- **`services/`** = things that run (long-running services).
- **`platform/`** = contracts, protocols, types, plugins, and internal `@allternit/*` TypeScript libraries.
- **`sdk/`** = public SDK surface only. **Location frozen** — do not move without an explicit decision.
- **`domains/`, `infrastructure/`, `surfaces/`** = existing semantics (domain logic; cloud providers/executors/bridges; web + desktop apps).

`packages/@allternit/` is legacy and is being consolidated into `platform/`. The former `api/` root was dissolved into `services/` on 2026-09-18 (S2): `gateway/routing` (allternit-tools-gateway), `workspace-service`, `ssh-bridge`, and `replies-runtime` now live under `services/`.

## Three SDKs

The repo carries three distinct SDKs — keep them straight:

| SDK | Location | Language | Release tag |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|
| Public Allternit SDK | `sdk/` | TypeScript | `sdk/v*` |
| Rust SDK | `platform/rust-sdk/rust/` (crates `sdk-core`, `sdk-transport`, `sdk-policy`, `sdk-functions`, `sdk-apps`) | Rust | cargo workspace |
| Gizzi SDK | `cmd/gizzi-code/packages/sdk/` | TypeScript | `gizzi-sdk/v*` |

> NOTE: `platform/sdk/` → `platform/rust-sdk/` rename is **done** (2026-09-18) so `sdk/` (public TS SDK) is unambiguous.

## Satellite Repos

These repos are published independently to NPM and have their own GitHub releases.

| Repo | NPM Package | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [`allternit-sdk`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-sdk) | `@allternit/sdk` | AI runtime, providers, ACP, and OpenAPI client |
| [`allternit-plugin-sdk`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-plugin-sdk) | `@allternit/plugin-sdk` | Universal plugin SDK with 6 adapters |
| [`allternit-api-client`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-api-client) | `@allternit/api-client` | TypeScript API client |
| [`gizzi-code`](https://github.com/Gizziio/gizzi-code) | `@allternit/gizzi-code` | Workspace-aware AI CLI |
| [`allternit-plugins`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-plugins) | `@allternit/*-plugin` | 12 ready-to-use card plugins |
| [`allternit-docs`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-docs) | — | Documentation websites |
| [`allternit-assets`](https://github.com/Gizziio/allternit-assets) | — | Brand assets and logos |

## Development Workflow

1. **Day-to-day development** happens in `allternit-platform`.
2. When a satellite package is ready for release:
   - Code is extracted from the monorepo
   - Pushed to the satellite repo
   - Tagged and released on GitHub
   - Published to NPM

## NPM Organization

All packages are published under the **`@allternit`** scope:

```bash
npm install @allternit/sdk
npm install @allternit/plugin-sdk
npm install @allternit/api-client
npm install -g @allternit/gizzi-code
npm install -g @allternit/marketresearchcard-plugin
```
